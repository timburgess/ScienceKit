The Swift programming language is highly applicable to writing programs that perform analysis on scientific data. Swift is/has:

* easy to learn and modern syntax 
* runs on Linux, OS X and also iOS
* comes with a free and highly capable IDE (Xcode) on OS X with inbuilt debugger
* a REPL for experimenting with code
* an ecosystem of open-source packages on Github
* the ability to make C function calls inline 
* last but not least, superb performance in compiled form
 
## ScienceKit

ScienceKit is a free Xcode 7.2 workspace that contains a number of example projects. Each project demonstrates how to use scientific functions and libraries (modules) available in the project. Projects presently contain:

**Upsurge** - simple but high-performance SIMD functions for vectors and matrices, digital signal processing and image manipulation

**HDF5Kit** - read and write access to HDF5 files for scientific datasets

**SwiftCSV** - utility for easily reading columns and rows of CSV files

All libraries provided have been built with the Swift version 2.2 snapshot provided by Apple. In order to use a project, you will need to follow the installation instructions at https://swift.org/download/#latest-development-snapshots
